# moldgen

I made this for 3d printing a mold of a 3d model I designed for casting in concrete in a class

To use the script you'll need to:
1) clean up your model and make sure you get rid of non-manifold edges / inner-geometry
2) specify your .stl file in the script and configure dimensions appropriately
